The goal of hello world is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Testanto os pacotes do SixSigma.

```{r echo= FALSE, fig.height=10, fig.width= 8, fig.align='center'}
library(SixSigma)
voltmeter <- factor(rep(1:2, each = 9))
battery <- factor(rep(rep(1:3, each = 3), 2))
run <- factor(rep(1:3, 6))
voltage <- c(1.4727, 1.4206, 1.4754, 1.5083, 1.5739,
1.4341, 1.5517, 1.5483, 1.4614, 1.3337,
1.6078, 1.4767, 1.4066, 1.5951, 1.8419,
1.7087, 1.8259, 1.5444)
batteries <- data.frame(voltmeter, battery,
run, voltage)
head(batteries)

my.rr <- ss.rr(var = voltage, part = battery, appr = voltmeter, data = batteries, main = "Six Sigma Gage R&R Measure", sub = "Batteries Project MSA")



```


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
